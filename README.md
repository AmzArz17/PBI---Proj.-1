Create a visual that clearly shows most profitable products:  <br/>
 - I decided to put the top 10 most profitable products and the top 5 least profiting products for for visual ease <br/>
 - The country dots represent the success of the revenue in each country
 - I chose a line graph to show the development of the revenue over time
